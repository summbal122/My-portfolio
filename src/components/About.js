        <p className="mb-4">
          I am a passionate Frontend Developer specializing in building dynamic, user-centric, and scalable web applications. With expertise in React.js, Next.js, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, I create interfaces that are not only responsive and accessible but also optimized for performance and cross-browser compatibility.
        </p>
        <p>
        My experience spans from developing B2B marketplaces and multilingual platforms to designing admin dashboards, authentication flows, and real-time integrations. I am well-versed in testing frameworks (Jest, RTL), agile workflows, and deployment tools like Vercel and Firebase, ensuring both reliability and scalability. Beyond coding, I bring an eye for UI/UX design, animations, and prototypes with Figma and Framer Motion, enabling me to deliver solutions that merge aesthetics with technical excellence.
